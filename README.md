# MCtandem
# An MIC cluster-enabled spectrum dot product algorithm for fast peptide identification
MCtandem is a parallel peptide database search sequencing tool based on Many Integrated Core (MIC) cluster. It significantly increases the efficiency of database search sequencing and thus is significant in deriving peptide sequences from mass spectrometry data. 

# Installation and Requirements
Hardware requirements: MIC cluster. Each Intel MIC workstation besides containing an Intel Xeon E5-2640 v2 processor with 8 physical cores clocked at 2.0 GHz and 8G RAM, and an Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor 7120P series with 61 cores at 1.33 GHz and 16G RAM. The running OS is NeoKylin 3.2, 64 bits. 
A proper process/thread/memory affinity is the basis for optimal performance. Therefore, some default setting needs to be modified. The details of the configuration parameters are as follows:
Module load craype-hunepages2M
Export MKL_FAST_MEMORY_LIMIT = 0
Export OMP_PROC_BIND = TRUE	
Export OMP_PLACES = threads
Export OMP_STACKSIZE = 512m
Export OMP_NUM_THREADS = 16
Usage:
# Single
Requirements:
ssh mic0;
mkdir tandem-mic;
mkdir raw;
logout;
cd /home/lichuang/tandem-mic;
scp -r bin fasta mic0:/tmp/tandem-mic;
cd /home/lichaung/raw;

eg:<path to tandem>/MCtandem.exe input-path output-path or<param.xml>

# Cluster
Requirements:
  To build MCtandem, the following additional packages are required:
  - MPI.  
  - Boost Serialization library. 
  
eg:mpiexec -n N -machinefile  ~./machinefile.txt ./MCtandem.exe input-path output-path
